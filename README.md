## Lenovo Haswell U330/U430/U530 DSDT patches by RehabMan

This set of patches/makefile can be used to patch your Lenovo U330/U430/U530 Touch(and p) DSDT/SSDTs.  There are also post install scripts that can be used to create and install the kexts the are required for this laptop series.

Although older versions of the repo had scripts to automate patching of DSDT/SSDTs, the current version does it all via config.plist hotpatching and SSDT-HACK.

- add "gray" tagging to files installed to /S/L/E and /Applications

2015-03-26

- instead of deleting _PRW objects, add them back but with sleep state 0.  This eliminates the disrupting call to the associated _GPE event during the sleep process.
